Instructions for SV-COMP'15
===========================

0) Dependencies:

   * GCC and G++
    - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by packages called 'g++' and 'gcc'.
	  We tested our tool using 'gcc-4.6'
	  
   * CMake 2.8+
     - available at http://www.cmake.org
     - the executable is called 'cmake'
     - usually provided by a package called 'cmake'

   * Boost libraries 1.37+
     - available at http://www.boost.org/
     - package is usually called 'boost'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'boost-devel' sub-package

   * 32bit system headers, especially in case of 64bit OS
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'libc6-dev-i386'
     - you can try to check their presence
       by 'gcc -m32 -o /dev/null /usr/include/stdlib.h'

   * GCC plugin devel
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'gcc-X-multilib' 'gcc-X-plugin-dev'
	   where X is version of gcc, e.g. gcc-4.6-multilib for gcc version 4.6.

   * Flex and Bison
     - Flex should be in version 2.5 or higher and Bison in version 2.7 or higher.
	 - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'flex' and 'bison'

   * Python 2.7
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'python2.7'

1) Build Forester from sources against GCC system. We recommend to use gcc 4.6.
   For bulding use following command:
             
                 ./switch-host-gcc.sh PATH_TO_GCC

	E.g. for gcc 4.6 is PATH_TO_GCC = /usr/bin/gcc-4.6

	Please check 'README' for further information about Forester compilation
	or 'fa/libvata/README' for further information about libVATA compilation
	(libVATA is Tree Automata library included in Forester).
   

2) Use script 'fa_build/sv_comp_run.py' for run of a SV-COMP test-case.

    Usage: sv_comp_run.py [-h] --trace TRACE [--properties PROPERTIES] file
       -h
	      Print help 
       --trace TRACE
	      A file to print witness to
	   --properties PROPERTIES
	      A file with specified verification properties.
		  When the property file is not specified it is used
		  folder_of_file/ALL.prp where folder_of_file is folder of
		  a file with test case. This default file is defined by
		  the competition rules.
	   file
	      A path to a file with test case

	   Since Forester participates only in Memory Safety and Heap Manipulation categories
	   the 32 bit architecture is used as default and cannot be changed by any parameter.
      
   A result of a verification task is an item from {TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN}
   and it is printed to standard output. When the result of verification
   task is FALSE, the related witness trace is printed to the specified
   trace. When there are more verification properties to be checked and
   one of them is violated, the answer has format FALSE(p) where p is
   violated property.
   Note that the script 'fa_build/sv_comp_run.py' requires Python 2.7.
