Instructions for SV-COMP'16
===========================

0) Dependencies:

   * GCC and G++
    - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by packages called 'g++' and 'gcc'.
    We tested our tool using 'gcc-4.8' for compiling test cases
	and 'g++-4.8' and the newer for compiling Forester.

   * CMake 2.8+
     - available at http://www.cmake.org
     - the executable is called 'cmake'
     - usually provided by a package called 'cmake'

   * Boost libraries 1.37+
     - available at http://www.boost.org/
     - the package is usually called 'boost' o 'lib-boost'
     - on binary distros you may need also the 'boost-devel' (or 'lib-all-dev') sub-package

   * 32bit system headers, especially in the case of a 64bit OS
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'libc6-dev-i386'
     - you can try to check their presence by
       'gcc -m32 -o /dev/null /usr/include/stdlib.h'

   * GCC plugin devel
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'gcc-X-multilib' 'gcc-X-plugin-dev'
       where X is version of gcc, e.g. gcc-4.8-multilib for gcc version 4.8.

   * Python 2.7
     - on Ubuntu/Debian provided by a package called 'python2.7'

1) Build Forester from the sources against your GCC system; we recommend to use gcc 4.8.
   For building Forester, use the following command:

                 ./switch-host-gcc.sh PATH_TO_GCC

  E.g. for gcc 4.8 in the standard path use

                 ./switch-host-gcc.sh /usr/bin/gcc-4.8

  Please check 'README' for further information about Forester compilation or
  'fa/libvata/README' for further information about the compilation of libVATA
  (libVATA is a tree automata library used by Forester).

2) Use the script './sv_comp_run.py' (also located in 'fa_build/sv_comp_run.py')
   to run Forester on a test-case:

    Usage: sv_comp_run.py [-h] --trace TRACE [--properties PROPERTIES] [--time] file

      -h
          Print help 

      --trace TRACE
          The file to print the witness to (for the answer FALSE)

      --properties PROPERTIES
          The file with the specified verification properties. When not
          specified, the default path for a property file in case of verified
		  file 'path/file' is 'path/ALL.prp'.

      --time
          Print consumed CPU time

      file
          The path to the file with program under verification

   Since Forester participates only in the HeapMemSafety category
   the 32-bit architecture is used by default and cannot be changed
   by any parameter of the script.

   A result of a verification task is an item from { TRUE, FALSE, UNKNOWN } and
   is printed to the standard output. When the result of a verification task is
   FALSE, the related witness trace is printed to the file specified by the
   --trace option. When there are more verification properties to be checked
   and one of them is violated, the answer has the format FALSE(p) where p is
   the violated property.

3) For evalutation of Forester with 'Benchexec' use 'rundefinition' XML item
   for definition of parameter '--trace' in XML configuration file.
   The other attributes are set in function 'cmdline' in Forester wrapping script for 'Benchexec'.
   An example of configuration XML file for Benchexec is 'benchmark-example-forester.xml'
   in this folder.
